# FacebookDemoSwift

I worked for about 3 hours on this lab, and got stuck a few places for a while.
I was able to do through part 2, except I couldn't get the posts variable to be non-empty.
It would be full during the reload() call, but then after reload ended and I called numberOfRowsInSection,
posts would be empty. So posts.count would be 0. 

I tried for a while to figure out why this was occurring.
